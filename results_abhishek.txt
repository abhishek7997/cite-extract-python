Paragraph: Despite the low computational cost of the Na ve Bayes technique, it has not been competitive in terms of classi cation accuracy when compared to SVM (Abbasi et al., 2008; Pang et al., 2002) and therefore we only analyze the NB method comparatively in the context of our experimental results.

Paragraph: Usual feature selection methods are document frequency (Bai, 2011; Dang et al., 2010; Pang et al., 2002), mutual information (Li et al., 2009; Turney, 2002), information gain (Abbasi et al., 2011, 2008; Li et al., 2009; Riloff, Patwardhan, & Wiebe, 2006) and chi-square (Abbasi et al., 2011; Li et al., 2009). None of them has been widely accepted as the best feature selection method for sentiment classi cation or text categorization, however, information gain has often been competitive (Abbasi et al., 2011; Forman, 2003; Li et al., 2009; Xia & Zong, 2010; Yang & Pedersen, 1997). In summary, although reducing input features is critical to make the ANN training process practical, it does not represent a disadvantage in comparison to SVM, since SVM also bene ts from the feature selection (Abbasi et al., 2011, 2008; Dang et al., 2010; Li et al., 2009), especially in the context of large-scale sentiment classi cation tasks (Bespalov et al., 2011).

Paragraph: Although the scaled conjugate gradient method (Fodslette & Mnller, 1993) focus on accelerating the process of convergence, the reported results showed that the method failed to converge less often than traditional conjugate gradient or back-propagation using gradient descent. Instead of adopting the traditional gradient descent method, we use the scaled conjugated gradient to speed up the convergence to a solution (Fodslette & Mnller, 1993), as implemented in the Matlab software.

Paragraph: It makes possible to determine a nonlinear decision boundary, which is linear in the higher-dimensional feature space, without computing the parameters of the optimal hyperplane in a feature space of possibly high dimensionality (Haykin, 1998). Each connection has an associated weight, whose value is estimated by minimizing a global error function in a gradient descent training process (Haykin, 1998). Fundamental comparison between SVM and ANN Formally, SVM and feed-forward neural networks are structurally similar, since both of them induce an output function which is expressed as a linear combination of simple functions (Romero & Toppo, 2007): f x b M X kkh xk; x : k 1 4 The bias term b is common for both SVM and ANN (Haykin, 1998) and Table 1 explains the meaning of the remaining terms from both SVM and ANN points of view. Although the de nition of an appropriate number M of hidden nodes in designing of a neural network is not a trivial task, the model complexity is usually controlled by keeping the number of hidden nodes small (Haykin, 1998). (4) From the SVM point of view M Number of support vectors h fxkgM fkkgM k 1 k 1 Kernel function Support vectors Coef cients found by the convex optimization problem From the ANN point of view Number of nodes in the hidden layer Activation function Hidden layer weights Output layer weights methods, which may not converge to the optimal/global solution (Hastie et al., 2001; Haykin, 1998).

Paragraph: In comparison with the sentiment classi cation literature, the main contributions of our work are: (i) a comparison of a dominant and a computationally ef cient approach (SVM and NB, respectively) with an ANN-based approach under the same context; (ii) a comparison involving realistic contexts in which the ratio of positive and negative reviews is unbalanced; (iii) a performance evaluation of ANN on a full version of the benchmark dataset of Movies reviews (Pang & Lee, 2004). Some datasets are available and have been used by many researchers in order to compare results, and the dataset of movie reviews (Pang & Lee, 2004) is the most popular benchmark dataset in the literature.1 Since the focus of our study is on the overall opinion (positive or negative) expressed in a review, we have oriented our literature review towards document-level sentiment classi cation, which assumes that a review document expresses opinions on a single product or service and was written by a single reviewer/customer. Datasets We conducted experiments on four datasets, which are the benchmark Movies review dataset (Pang & Lee, 2004) and collections of reviews extracted from amazon.com in distinct product domains: GPS, Books and Cameras. Regarding the sentiment learning literature, our main ndings/contributions are in the following points: (cid:4) In terms of classi cation accuracy on the benchmark dataset of Movies reviews (Pang & Lee, 2004), ANN outperformed signi cantly (statistically) SVM, specially in the context of unbalanced data.

Paragraph: Basically, most of the methods in the literature are composed of two parts: (i) feature selection and (ii) sentiment learning/ classi cation (Abbasi, France, Zhang, & Chen, 2011; Chen, Liu, & Chiu, 2011; Li, Xia, Zong, & Huang, 2009; Pang et al., 2002). The most popular sentiment learning techniques are SVM and NB, and many authors have reported better accuracy by using SVM (Abbasi, 2010; Dang et al., 2010; O Keefe & Koprinska, 2009; Pang et al., 2002; Prabowo & Thelwall, 2009; Ye, Zhang, & Law, 2009). Usual feature selection methods are document frequency (Bai, 2011; Dang et al., 2010; Pang et al., 2002), mutual information (Li et al., 2009; Turney, 2002), information gain (Abbasi et al., 2011, 2008; Li et al., 2009; Riloff, Patwardhan, & Wiebe, 2006) and chi-square (Abbasi et al., 2011; Li et al., 2009). Despite the low computational cost of the Na ve Bayes technique, it has not been competitive in terms of classi cation accuracy when compared to SVM (Abbasi et al., 2008; Pang et al., 2002) and therefore we only analyze the NB method comparatively in the context of our experimental results.

Paragraph: Fundamental comparison between SVM and ANN Formally, SVM and feed-forward neural networks are structurally similar, since both of them induce an output function which is expressed as a linear combination of simple functions (Romero & Toppo, 2007): f x b M X kkh xk; x : k 1 4 The bias term b is common for both SVM and ANN (Haykin, 1998) and Table 1 explains the meaning of the remaining terms from both SVM and ANN points of view. This property does not usually hold for ANN (Romero & Toppo, 2007) and the number M of hidden nodes in a neural network is a free parameter which is usually xed previously. However, it is important to note that a large set of support vectors can be needed to form the output function, making SVM computationally slow in running time (test phase) and expensive for real-time applications (Burges, 1998; Romero & Toppo, 2007).

Paragraph: One of the criticisms raised against lexicon-based methods is that the dictionaries are unreliable, as they are either built automatically or hand-ranked by humans (Andreevskaia and Bergler 2008). 2.9 Evaluation of SO-CAL in Other Domains Reference to domain portability, in this article and in other work, is usually limited to portability across different types of reviews (Aue and Gamon 2005; Blitzer, Dredze, and Pereira 2007; Andreevskaia and Bergler 2008). We tested SO-CAL with four different data sets: the Multi-Perspective Question Answering (MPQA) corpus, version 2.0 (Wiebe, Wilson, and Cardie 2005); a collection of MySpace.com comments from Mike Thelwall (Prabowo and Thelwall 2009); a set of news and blog posts from Alina Andreevskaia (Andreevskaia and Bergler 2008); and a set of headlines from Rada Mihalcea and Carlo Strappavara (Strappavara and Mihalcea 2007).20 The rst set of data is the MPQA corpus (version 2.0), a collection of news articles and other documents (texts from the American National Corpus and other sources) annotated for opinions and other private states (beliefs, emotions, speculation, etc.). Support Vector Machine (SVM) classi ers have been shown to outperform lexicon-based models within a single domain (Kennedy and Inkpen 2006); they have trouble with cross-domain tasks (Aue and Gamon 2005), however, and some researchers have argued for hybrid classi ers (Andreevskaia and Bergler 2008).

Paragraph: This markedness is true in terms of linguistic form, with negative forms being marked across languages (Greenberg 1966), and it is also manifested as (token) frequency distribution, with negatives being less frequent (Boucher and Osgood 1969).15 Negation tends to be expressed in euphemistic ways, which makes negative sentiment more dif cult to identify in general. 2.6 Text-Level Features Lexicon-based sentiment classi ers generally show a positive bias (Kennedy and Inkpen 2006), likely the result of a universal human tendency to favor positive language (Boucher and Osgood 1969).16 In order to overcome this problem, Voll and Taboada (2007) implemented normalization, shifting the numerical cut-off point between positive and negative reviews. This is mostly likely attributable to the default status of positive, and the marked character of negative expression (Boucher and Osgood 1969; Horn 1989; Jing-Schmidt 2007); neutral description might be taken as being vaguely positive, but it would not be mistaken for negative expression.26 For the word-pair task, we categorize the distribution data by the difference in SO between the two words, putting negative and positive words in separate tables.

Citation: Horn 1989

Paragraph: The rst approach is fairly liberal, and allows us to capture the true effects of negation raising (Horn 1989), where the negator for a verb moves up and attaches to the verb in the matrix clause. One other interesting aspect of the pragmatics of negation is that negative statements tend to be perceived as more marked than their af rmative counterparts, both pragmatically and psychologically (Osgood and Richards 1973; Horn 1989, chapter 3). This is mostly likely attributable to the default status of positive, and the marked character of negative expression (Boucher and Osgood 1969; Horn 1989; Jing-Schmidt 2007); neutral description might be taken as being vaguely positive, but it would not be mistaken for negative expression.26 For the word-pair task, we categorize the distribution data by the difference in SO between the two words, putting negative and positive words in separate tables.

Paragraph: In general, there is signi cantly less positive bias in the movie review domain, most likely due to the use of negative terms in plot and character description (Taboada, Brooke, and Stede 2009), thus the negative weighting that is appropriate for other domains is often excessive for movie reviews. The main conclusion of our work is that lexicon-based methods for sentiment analysis are robust, result in good cross-domain performance, and can be easily enhanced with multiple sources of knowledge (Taboada, Brooke, and Stede 2009).

Paragraph: There exist two main approaches to the problem of extracting sentiment automatically.1 The lexicon-based approach involves calculating orientation for a document from the semantic orientation of words or phrases in the document (Turney 2002). 1966; Tong 2001), or automatically, using seed words to expand the list of words (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1997; Turney 2002; Turney and Littman 2003). 2007); adjectives and verbs (Kim and Hovy 2004); adjective phrases (Whitelaw, Garg, and Argamon 2005); two-word phrases (Turney 2002; Turney and Littman 2003); adjectives, verbs, and adverbs (Subrahmanian and Reforgiato 2008); the exclusive use of verbs (Sokolova and Lapalme 2008); the use of non-affective adjectives and adverbs (Sokolova and Lapalme 2009a, 2009b); or rationales, words and phrases selected by human annotators (Zaidan and Eisner 2008). The association is usually calculated following Turney s method for computing mutual information (Turney 2002; Turney and Littman 2003), but see also Rao and Ravichandran (2009) and Velikovich et al. As noted already by Boucher and Osgood (1969), there is a strong preference for avoiding negation and negative terms even when expressing negative opinions, making the detection of text sentiment dif cult for systems which depend solely on these indicators (also see results in Dave, Lawrence, and Pennock 2003, Turney 2002). Our rst comparison is with the dictionary of adjectives that was derived using the SO-PMI method (Turney 2002), using Google hit counts (Taboada, Anthony, and Voll 2006).

Paragraph: The analysis and automatic extraction of semantic orientation can be found under different umbrella terms: sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee 2008), subjectivity (Lyons 1981; Langacker 1985), opinion mining (Pang and Lee 2008), analysis of stance (Biber and Finegan 1988; Conrad and Biber 2000), appraisal (Martin and White 2005), point of view (Wiebe 1994; Scheibman 2002), evidentiality (Chafe and Nichols 1986), and a few others, without expanding into neighboring disciplines and the study of emotion (Ketal 1975; Ortony, Clore, and Collins 1988) and affect (Batson, Shaw, and Oleson 1992).

Paragraph: Comparing the performance of various dictionaries with or without SO-CAL features, two facts are apparent: First, SO-CAL features are generally bene cial no matter what dictionary is used (in fact, all Overall improvements from Basic to Full in Table 10 are statistically signi cant); the only exceptions are due to negative weighting in the movie domain, which for most of the dictionaries causes a drop in performance.35 Second, the bene t provided by SO-CAL seems to be somewhat dependent on the reliability of the dictionary; in general, automatically derived SO dictionaries derive less bene t from the use of linguistic features, and the effects are, on the whole, much less consistent; this is in fact the same conclusion we reached in other work where we compared automatically translated dictionaries to manually built ones for Spanish (Brooke, To loski, and Taboada 2009). In related work, we have also shown that creating a new version of SO-CAL for a new language, Spanish, is as fast as building text classi ers for the new language, and results in better performance (Brooke 2009; Brooke, To loski, and Taboada 2009).

The idea behind the centroid classification algorithm is extremely simple and straightforward (Songho tan, 2008). The similarity score of each nearest neighbor document to the test document is used as the weight of the classes of the neighbor document (Songho tan, 2008). During the training phase, with a collection of training data, this process is repeated several times by iterating on the data (Songho tan, 2008).

In contrast, SentiStrength was able to identify negative sentiment little better (1.8%) than the baseline, probably due to creativity in expressing negative comments or due to the dif culty in getting signi cantly above the baseline when one category dominates (Artstein & Poesio, 2008; Krippendorff, 2004).

Although this model is useful, other research has shown that positive and negative sentiment can coexist (e.g., Fox, 2008, p. 127) and are relatively independent in many contexts particularly when sentiment levels are not extreme and over longer time periods (Diener & Emmons, 1984; Huppert & Whittington, 2003; Watson, 1988; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) and so it also seems reasonable to conceive sentiment as separately measurable positive and negative components, as encoded in a popular psychology research instrument (Watson et al., 1988). One computer science initiative has attempted to identify various emotions in text, focusing on the six so-called basic emotions (Ekman, 1992; Fox, 2008) of anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise (Strapparava & Mihalcea, 2008).

Paragraph: information gain (Riloff, Patwardhan, & Wiebe, 2006), or log likelihood (Gamon, 2004). In terms of classi cation algorithms, support vector machines (SVMs) are widely used (Abbasi et al., 2008; Abbasi et al., 2008; Argamon et al., 2007; Gamon, 2004; Mishne, 2005; Wilson, Wiebe, & Hwa, 2006) because they seem to perform as well or better than other methods in most machine learning contexts. Nevertheless, a study of poor grammatical quality texts in online customer feedback showed that linguistic approaches could improve classi cation slightly when added to bag of words (1-grams) approaches, although aggressive feature reduction had a similar impact to adding linguistic features (Gamon, 2004). Previous work has shown that this approach is promising, particularly via dependency trees (Wilson et al., 2009) and that, given a large enough training sample, improvements may be possible even in poor-quality text (Gamon, 2004).

In contrast, SentiStrength was able to identify negative sentiment little better (1.8%) than the baseline, probably due to creativity in expressing negative comments or due to the dif culty in getting signi cantly above the baseline when one category dominates (Artstein & Poesio, 2008; Krippendorff, 2004).

The improvement was probably due to the large data set available (40,884 documents with an average of 2.26 sentences each), as has been previously claimed for an analysis of informal text (Mishne, 2005). This is probably because the texts analyzed are typically short (average 200 words) and there are many moods, some of which are very similar to each other, although even a binary categorization task also had limited success (Mishne, 2005).

Paragraph: Although this model is useful, other research has shown that positive and negative sentiment can coexist (e.g., Fox, 2008, p. 127) and are relatively independent in many contexts particularly when sentiment levels are not extreme and over longer time periods (Diener & Emmons, 1984; Huppert & Whittington, 2003; Watson, 1988; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) and so it also seems reasonable to conceive sentiment as separately measurable positive and negative components, as encoded in a popular psychology research instrument (Watson et al., 1988).

Paragraph: Nevertheless, with a few exceptions (Read, 2005; Wilson et al., 2006), explicit comparisons with other methods have not been included in opinion mining publications. Sentiment strength classi cation has also been developed for a three-level scheme (low, medium, and high or extreme) for subjective sentences or clauses in newswire texts using a linguistic analysis converting sentences into dependency trees re ecting their structure (Wilson et al., 2006). SentiStrength was able to identify the strength of positive sentiment on a scale of 1 to 5 in 60.6% of the time in informal MySpace language, signi cantly above the best standard machine-learning approaches, which had a performance of up to 58.5% in line with those for a previous four-category opinion intensity classi cation task (Wilson et al., 2006).
